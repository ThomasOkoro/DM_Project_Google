Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets: 

In this project we are challenged to build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. 

Our data consists of a dataset of 6,471 tweets that are already classified (0 = fake news, 1 = real news).

The project topic is based around a Kaggle competition. Competition page:https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/final-project-of-the-data-mining-and-machine-learning-course/leaderboards
