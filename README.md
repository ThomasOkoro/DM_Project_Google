Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets: 

In this project we are challenged to build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. 
Our data consists of a dataset of 6,471 tweets that are already classified (0 = fake news, 1 = real news).

The project topic is based around a Kaggle competition. Competition page:https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/final-project-of-the-data-mining-and-machine-learning-course/leaderboards

## Project structure üöÄ


**1. Load and visualize (EDA)**

- Import and describe database, visualize distribution of features.

**2. Base rate of database**

- Compute the Base rate of Target.

**3. Data cleaning and improvement of our model**

- Text preprocessing, text cleaning and improvisation.

**4. Training of our logistic model and prediction on test data**

- Training and definition of our Classifier and its accuracy. Test data prediction.

**5. Development of our model**

- kNN method and decision trees.

**6. Results presentation**

## Results ü•á

During the first weeks we obtained our first accuracy for our model classifier.

Our base rate = 0.57
Our accuracy = 0.809
